This directory contains ImageJ2's logos and icons
from prior to the adoption of its current logo.

The microscope in the logo was based on a photograph of a Bausch + Lomb
optical microscope from the UW Microscopy Museum collection at LOCI.

The photograph was taken by Johannes Schindelin and Curtis Rueden,
and reworked into cartoon form by Adam Fraser.
